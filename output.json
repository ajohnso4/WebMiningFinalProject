I had a call with the recruiter, it was a very quick call. Just to let me know that they liked my CV, wanted to introduce himself and have a quick chat with me. Then basically just told me that he'll set up a meeting for a technical interview. \n\nA few weeks later I had 30-minute interview with a senior member on the team. The interviewer was very friendly and made me feel at ease. The questions were fairly simple in my opinion, having 9 years of experience total and 2.5 years with Azure. The interviewer didn't give off much at the end of the interview but wished me good luck in the rest of the process. \n\nI checked in with my recruiter a couple times over the next couple of weeks for a status update. I was then invited to do a hiring day which consisted of three 45 minute interviews back to back . \n\nThe first interview I did was a more advanced technical interview. We went quite a bit deeper on subjects within Azure. I made a point to stick to the STAR answering method. When I didn't know a question, I didn't babble on lying about it. I apologised and said I didn't know the answer to the question, but detailed resources that I would use to start troubleshooting and figuring it out. Whenever I had any related experiences I brought those up, detailed the situation, what I needed to do, how I went about doing it and the result. \n\nThe second interview was a project presentation. I had to give a sales/business style presentation on a project I'd recently done. How I decided to design the architecture solution and presented a visio file. I discussed the costs and how we settled on those, how it would be supported and other design reasons. Note that this was aimed for a non-technical type interview. They wanted to understand my business presentation skills for all levels of attendees. After the project presentation was finished I was asked a few more questions to demonstrate scenarios I'd had with customers. Giving examples of negotiations, discovery, agreeing on points which needed to be fixed, how we'd get there, set expectations etc. All the usual stuff you'd expect. \n\nThen I had a manager interview to finish where I was asked more about my previous experiences, my motivations, mindset, aspirations. I spoke about my values, how they aligned with Microsoft values, how I get my enjoyment from my work, examples of how I've helped build team morale and motivations within work, improvements I've made etc. After this hiring day, it took about 3-4 weeks for the positive feedback from my recruiter.

It was held on mettl IDE and having no prior practice experience on their IDE, it was somewhat difficult for me to get comfortable with it. But eventually, within 90 minutes I was able to solve 2 Questions which cleared my way to take Round 2. The results were declared late night that day and we were supposed to attend Round-2 early in the morning.\n\nI don\u2019t remember the questions exactly, but i can tell you some of them:\n\nYou are given n number of sticks of different lengths. Length of each stick is given in an array and we had to find the minimum cost required to make all sticks of same length. (Given that Every stick has a cost associated with it in an array to increase or decrease one unit of length.)\nThere are n number of students in a class and there are n number of lunchboxes. Each lunch box is either a circle or a rectangle and each student has a particular priority of lunch box i.e. if the lunch box is of his priority than he will take it and go otherwise he will go back of the queue and wait for his/her turn.(Students are aligned in a queue and lunch boxes are arranged in a stack.). So given n and the two arrays, one for lunch box type and another of student priority, you have to tell how many students won\u2019t be able to eat their lunch.\nRound 2: Around 54 people were shortlisted from first round from around 250 people and were allowed to give round 2 which was a Group Fly round. In this round, we were given a problem and we have to solve that problem in 45 minutes by writing the approach and code on paper in a neat manner. Literally, I was thinking of how to write the code without any errors for 35 minutes, then I started writing the code. They told us that they are open to any language, so I decided to write the code in Python 3. The result of Group Fly round was declared within an hour.\n\nThe problem was:\n\nYou are given a path to a folder and a set of words. There are some files in the folder and you have to search the words in those files that if they exist or not. If there is a match, then output the path of the file and the word.\n\nRound 3: After Group fly round, around 25 people were shortlisted and were told to give the Technical Interview in the next 15 minutes. We were splitted in to groups(In each group number of students were equal to the number of rooms in which recruiters were sitting) in order to conduct this round in an efficient manner. I was in the first group, So they called my name and I was told to go to a particular room. After entering the room, The interviewer asked me my approach to solve the problem which was given in group fly round. I explained him that approach. Then he asked me some questions related to array, one of which was to output the triplet in an array which has sum zero(0) but the triplets would maintain their order as they are in that array. I was able to do that one by reducing the time complexity from O(n^3) to O(n^2). Then he asked me about my projects which were of Machine Learning, I was able to answer most of them. Then he told me to wait for the results.\n\nRound 4: I got my Group Fly round and technical Interview-I pretty good so they skipped my Round-4, which was Technical Round-II and I was directed to a new room in which I had Interview with the HR of the Company. Some of the students gave Technical Round-II also.\n\nRound 5: This was the final round and i had the Interview with the HR which was on Skype. He asked me about my previous round experience like how did I solved the problems, What was the most challenging part, My weaknesses, My strengths and many other questions to evaluate me. After sometime, They called me and told me that I got selected for Microsoft Internship. I was really very happy and was not able to express my happiness.\n\nOverall, All the interviewers including the Technical and HR ones were very Chill and told us not to get nervous and give out best."}, {"interview_title": "Data Engineer Interview", "date": "Oct 23, 2022", "offer_acceptance": "No Offer", "experience_rating": "Positive Experience", "interview_rating": "Average Interview", "interview_process": "Good, overall it was ok, though from my side it was great but looked for boys in that role where programing data manager.

For the on-site, three of the interviews were a mix of technical and behavioral questions, and the final one was purely behavioral with an engineering manager. All my interviewers were kind, and I had a comfortable experience for the most part. \n\nI was fortunate enough to receive an offer as an SDE level 60. Prior to extending the formal offer, they asked about my compensation expectations. Although my request was on the higher end, I was told that they were going to \u201ctry to get as close to that number as possible\u201d. However, the offer they ended up making was a complete low-ball, as the base salary was much lower than what I\u2019m currently making and the TC was over $70k less than what I had asked for. Overall, the TC package as a whole was simply not competitive for my skill level or the industry. \n\nI attempted to negotiate this by asking for an increase in the base salary, as I value having a guaranteed income and wanted this number to be higher than what I was currently making. They claimed the offer was \u201cfinal\u201d as given, which really threw me off. It was extremely surprising that they outright refused to negotiate, since the offer didn\u2019t make financial sense to me. I had to turn it down as a result, and was told that the offer would be attached to my name for the next 6 months should I go through the interview process and land a level 60 role again. Like, what?! The reason I turned it down was because the offer was bad in the first place! Seemed a little vindictive to me\u2026\n\nUpon doing a bit more research, it appears that some folks have shared similar experiences with their Microsoft interview processes on Blind, DESPITE having competing offers at the same time. It\u2019s pretty clear to me that Microsoft has absolutely no incentive or regard for what candidates are looking for. The arrogance of a company to basically say \u201cif you want this job, it has to be COMPLETELY on our terms. We are not willing to come to a middle ground for you\u201d doesn\u2019t bode well for future employment with them. If they weren\u2019t willing to work with me here, why would I trust them to support me while I\u2019m on the job? The nicest they were ever going to be to me was while they were coaxing me into taking the job, so I wouldn\u2019t put it past them to potentially pull other things if I\u2019d accepted (giving me bonuses on the lower ends of the possible ranges, rescinding the offer after I accept + give my two weeks notice, etc). \n\nOverall, I was very disappointed with the outcome of this interview process, as I was initially very excited about the prospect of working there.

I didn't apply for a specific position as they had a generic Principal Software Engineer position open for multiple projects. The screening interview with Microsoft LinkedIn recruiter was brief, mostly talk about preferences and the interview process at Microsoft. The initial brief interview was followed by another with a Microsoft recruiter (different person) who explained the interview process in more details. The main interview consisted of 5 video calls: 1.) Call with Partner Engineering Manager - mostly talk about role I played at past projects, soft skills questions. 2-5.) 4 calls with (Senior) Principal Software Engineers and future team manager. These covered technical questions, coding/design challenge, soft skills questions. Each of these calls had a technical part. The challenges were definitely doable for someone experienced, I would even say of average difficulty. Overall the interview process was very professional in comparison to other companies I interviewed at. On the follow up call with Microsoft recruiter I learned the company was going to proceed with an offer however I decided not to go to that phase. There were some aspects of the project selected for me that I didn't like and one of the reasons for changing job was to avoid those issues. Changing job thus would not have fulfilled its purpose. Recruiter then came up with a few more projects and further video calls were conducted with project managers. Unfortunately projects offered were not in good alignment with my skills and expectations and would not have allowed me to make a difference and stand out. I have a quite a lot of experience that allows me to filter out bad projects. Hiring freeze came in and severely restricted projects that are hiring. There are some good projects at Microsoft abroad but local candidates have priority. Passing all interview rounds at Microsoft is not a huge problem provided you get selected, however finding a good project can be tough. I hope Microsoft recruiters didn't interpret my decision to decline all projects as being ungrateful as it is not the case. They have been very helpful and the interview process at Microsoft was most professional from all companies I interviewed at. Should Microsoft have a suitable project in the future I would be glad to apply again."}, {"interview_title": "Senior Product Manager Interview", "date": "Jan 19, 2023", "offer_acceptance": "No Offer", "experience_rating": "Positive Experience", "interview_rating": "Average Interview", "interview_process": "Began with 3 interview round with hiring manager and team.

Met with hiring manager who was very friendly and said they were super interested in me and needed my exact skillset. I was then moved directly to the final loop stage which involved 5 45 minute interviews with people on the team, the director of the organization, and people from adjacent teams who interact with the group. It was a long day of interviewing but the experience was very conversational, pleasant, and friendly. They made small talk, broke the ice a bit, and was one of the better interview experiences I've had, especially from a major tech company. There are 2 issues that unfortunately mar that experience for me. The first is that after that loop interview, it took 3 weeks to get a response back. I sent a couple of gentle messages to the recruiter who never responded at all and and after the 2nd message I just stopped altogether and assumed I probably wasn't going to get it. The second issue that left a bad taste in my mouth is that on the third week, the recruiter scheduled a call and told me that there was a contractor they already had doing the role and they decided to give the role to that person instead. Nobody had mentioned that to me in the interviews at all. That is a perfectly fine reason, of course, they're already internal, onboarding is reduced, they know the people, they can jump right in and get to work. Totally understandable. But then, why in the world would you post that job externally? Why take up about 7-8 hours of my time with meetings when you had an internal resource to begin with? I took a PTO day to do those all those interviews. So that is why I rate the experience neutral. I won't give it a negative, because the interviewers were very nice and welcoming, but I'm not going to give it a positive rating because they were very inconsiderate of my time and were incommunicado for 3 weeks after the loop interview. They should've just done a direct hire with their contractor or made the job posting internal only rather than drag external people in to waste their time. The role was a lower level program manager role and they certainly would have plenty of internal talent to fill the role."}, {"interview_title": "Data Scientist Interview", "date": "May 19, 2022", "offer_acceptance": "No Offer", "experience_rating": "Neutral Experience", "interview_rating": "Average Interview", "interview_process": "I first had a screening HR interview, then a phone interview with the team leader, then 1 hour data science interview, then an interview with higher manager and then HR again."}, {"interview_title": "Software Engineer(Internship) Interview", "date": "May 21, 2022", "offer_acceptance": "No Offer", "experience_rating": "Neutral Experience", "interview_rating": "Average Interview", "interview_process": "It was a nice experience for me.

He was very interested in my responses and asked lots of follow-up questions. Was also very nice. Unfortunately, this left only about 20 minutes to solve the tree question he asked. On top of solving it, I was also asked to implement the tree data structure (as shown in the prompt) and add a bunch of test cases to test my algorithm.

But what was most egregious was that my recruiter was nonexistent throughout the process, it literally felt like a robot was just sending me things to sign and never actually interacting with me. I sent multiple emails asking questions and even leaving voicemails, which went completely unanswered. It wasn\u2019t until I asked the interview coordinator (yes, a different person) who finally helped me get in contact with my supposed recruiter. She apologized and then promised to call me back, which again she never did (oh well). On the day of the virtual onsite, my first interviewer asked about how a JavaScript bundler works, which produced some awkwardness because I was not a frontend developer. He noted this and quickly pivoted the discussion to my Java experience, which made things even more awkward because my background wasn't in Java either (LOL). Clearly, he didn\u2019t review my resume/profile. The next interviewer was friendly but obviously not a native English speaker. We talked about situations where I had encountered disagreements and what I did to overcome them (pretty standard). We proceeded to the coding challenge and I recognized how a stack can be used to solve my problem. She tells me unless I can articulate clearly how I use the stack, I can\u2019t use it. Okay\u2026 well, I tell her that I\u2019m not 100% sure but sometimes having the code written down lets me visualize it and brainstorm better (we have our unique ways of doing things). Nope, not allowed to do it. I end up going with a brute force implementation which she obviously did not want. For the third interviewer, we get into the system design portion and I start drawing and talking about my approach. Again, it's hard to understand what they were asking (English not being their first language). In the end, they ding me for not asking enough clarification questions and not explaining my idea before jumping into the implementation. Sure, because I can certainly read minds and know what everyone's expectations are *sarcasm*. If you don't outline what your expectations are for the candidate, you can't fault them for making certain assumptions and taking liberties with their answer. Anyways, at this point, I\u2019ve had enough and I email the coordinator to withdraw my candidacy. I can honestly say this was unequivocally the worst and most unorganized interview I\u2019ve ever been a part of."}, {"interview_title": "Data and Applied Scientist Interview", "date": "Mar 23, 2022", "offer_acceptance": "No Offer", "experience_rating": "Negative Experience", "interview_rating": "Average Interview", "interview_process": "One of the worst interviews I've ever been through.

Microsoft currently has the worst unprofessional recruiters... \n\nMicrosoft keep people waiting (and ghosting) in hopes of finding a diversity candidate for the same spot to meet their diversity quota. So in simple words, they have a designed candidate for the role, but to validate the diversity quota, they keep interviewing people and wasting their time to close the process. They have no intent to hire you from the beginning."}, {"interview_title": "First Year Associate Interview", "date": "Feb 11, 2022", "offer_acceptance": "No Offer", "experience_rating": "Positive Experience", "interview_rating": "Difficult Interview", "interview_process": "It was terrible - Waited forever to get back to you, and didnt really ask good question.
